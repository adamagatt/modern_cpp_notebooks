    "## 8 - Smart Pointers: `shared_ptr`\n",
    "##### **Author: Adam Gatt**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of smart pointer is `shared_ptr` which allows for multiple \"owning\" references, and the dynamic data will be deleted when the last owning reference falls out of scope. This is achieved by a reference-counting approach (much like garbage collection in the JVM). It is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It cannot be made clear who the single authoritative owner should be\n",
    "* There is a need for multiple references but no guarantees on which of them will be finalised last (e.g. a multi-threaded environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour of `shared_ptr` is achieved by a reference-counting approach, much like garbage collection in the JVM. This comes at a cost compared to its unique counterpart:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The reference counter requires extra memory and prevents the smart pointer from being fully optimised away\n",
    "* It is possible to create \"reference cycles\" of two shared_ptrs with (perhaps indirect) references to each other, preventing either of them from being cleaned up\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, `shared_ptr` should not be used as a default approach where a `unique_ptr` would do instead. "

In short, if a smart pointer was created as a temporary object (e.g. such as in a function call) and then an exception occurs before the temporary object is used and resolved, there is a chance that the dynamic data would be successfully created but the creation of the owning smart pointer would fail. With no smart pointer to clean it up, the dynamic data would leak."

This rule fixes the above example and obviates the safety-based argument for using make_unique.
