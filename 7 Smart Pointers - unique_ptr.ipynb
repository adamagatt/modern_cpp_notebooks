    "## 7 - Smart Pointers: `unique_ptr`\n",
    "##### **Author: Adam Gatt**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: How do we know when to delete a dynamic object?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create objects in dynamic memory (i.e. on _the heap_) using the keywords `new` and `delete`. Objects created in this way do not follow the rules of scope like static objects do. They will not have their destructor called and memory freed when their originating scope block ends. Instead we must be sure to manually call `delete` to free the object when it is no longer needed.\n",
    "* If we fail to `delete` the object its memory will remain allocated but unused, resulting in a memory leak\n",
    "* If we use the object after it has been deleted we cause a [use after free](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/) error, or potential vulnerability\n",
    "* If our control logic [`delete`s the object twice](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#double-delete-disaster) then we enter _undefined_ behaviour and a runtime crash or worse may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that each object with a `new` statement must be matched with a corresponding `delete`. But in practice this rule may be surprisingly difficult to enforce due to complexities in reasoning about _object lifetimes_.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object's creation and end-of-life points might be very far away from each other in the code, requiring careful tracking of the object to see where it goes.\n",
    "* The object might flow through different control logic, resulting in multiple different areas where its end-of-life is expected and `delete` must be called. The logic must be checked to ensure that only one such call can be reached for each object.\n",
    "* We need to always be certain whether a variable is an array or not as we would need to call `delete[]` instead, and calling the wrong type of delete operator results in undefined behaviour\n",
    "* A dynamic object might be created (and returned) by a function, showing no `new` syntax in the immediate area around where the object is first used.\n",
    "* The object reference may be provided to a function call, which may \"consume\" the object (and thus delete it) or might not, depending on convention and how the function is expected to be used.\n",
    "* The object may be provided for storage in a data structure which may itself be deleted. Some data structures may delete their held references upon destruction (e.g. a list) and some may not (e.g. a cache).\n",
    "* There may be multiple references to the same dynamic object, potentially held in different threads, requiring us to be careful that only one reference is deleted and at a safe time. This often requires us to choose one reference as being responsible for object deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "Many libraries and idioms attempt to straighten out this complexity by modelling the concept of _object ownership_. A dynamic object only ever has a single _owning reference_, established when the object is created. Other references can be created to the object but only as temporary non-owning references. The ownership of the object can be transferred from the owner to another reference, even across function boundaries or between threads, but there is only one owner at any point in time. When the object is no longer required, the owning reference is responsible for deleting it. Non-owning references have a way to check whether the object has been deleted before attempting to make use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart pointers: A RAII approach to object ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart pointers are an application of the RAII technique towards memory management. We use RAII objects called _smart pointers_ to represent and track the ownership of the dynamic object. The smart pointers are then responsible for automatically deleting the object at the right time, according to the strategy used. C++ offers three types of smart pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `std::unique_ptr`\n",
    "\n",
    "`unique_ptr` is a single unambiguous owner of the dynamic object. By using the new [_move semantics_](https://iteo.medium.com/c-move-semantics-and-rvalue-references-explained-7efb7cf79a56) we can allow for the object to be transferred to a new owner at important boundaries (e.g. function boundaries). We follow scope-based rules to ensure that the object is eventually deleted when its current owner falls out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `std::shared_ptr`\n",
    "\n",
    "`shared_ptr` is for situations where multiple owners is required and unavoidable. In this model, you can have multiple `shared_ptr`s to the same dynamic object, and it will be deleted when all of its `shared_ptrs` have been destroyed (i.e. at the moment when the last surviving `shared_ptr` is destroyed). This is \n",
    "\n",
    "* `std::weak_ptr` is a weak, non-owning reference to a shared_ptr\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Please ignore the existence of std::auto_ptr\n",
    "auto_ptr is an earlier approach to smart pointers that didn't work out. It had issues with being stored in containers, it did not support hosting arrays, and it did not support the new move semantics. unique_ptr is considered as its replacement, and auto_ptr is deprecated in the language standard."
