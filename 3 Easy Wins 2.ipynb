    "How come the call to `scale()` succeeded even though the second parameter was a double instead of a Factor? It's because of the rules C++ uses when parsing a function call. If the compiler can't find a function declaration that matches the called signature, then it will attempt a process called _implicit conversion_. This involves looking around for any other functions that it can use to convert the arguments to types that will allow the original function call to succeed. It is similar to the promotion of primitives, so that you can pass an int to a function that expects a double, except broadened to apply to other types as well. The compiler will search for any user-defined conversion functions and constructors that it can use to perform the conversion process. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here:\n",
    "1. The call to `scale(int, double)` is initially unsuccessful as that signature has not been declared.\n",
    "2. The compiler notices the declaration `scale(int, const Factor&)` and determines if it can convert the arguments to match it.\n",
    "3. The compiler notices that `Factor(double value)` is available for creating a Factor out of a double.\n",
    "4. The compiler inserts the implicit conversion, effectively turning the function call into `scale(5, Factor(0.5))`, and creating a temporary Factor object to submit to the scale function.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ performs implicit conversion not only when calling functions, [but in a range of scenarios](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion) where one type is provided where another is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially this might seem like a benefit, for getting code to work that otherwise wouldn't. But remember that this all happens implicitly behind the scenes, without evidence in the source code itself. As a general rule, you want your application logic to be explicitly laid out to make the code more readable and verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the costs or risks of implicit conversion? They might include:\n",
    " * Function arguments being open to a far greater range of types than intended\n",
    " * An API that is open to guesswork rather than understanding proper usage\n",
    " * Creation of unintended temporary objects\n",
    " * Creation of objects at all that shouldn't be allowed (e.g. if the class is intended Singleton)\n",
    " * Reducing clarity of the intent of the codebase\n",
    " \n",
    "How do we crack down on implicit conversion, assuming we intend to? Remember that the implicit conversion comes about due to three factors:\n",
    "1. A function call with a signature that hasn't been declared\n",
    "2. A candidate signature that could be matched with some conversion\n",
    "3. A conversion function or constructor that can perform the conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the `explicit` keyword is provided to solve our problem by addressing factor 3. A conversion function or constructor that is marked explicit will only be used by the compiler if explicitly called in the codebase. It will not be considered during the implicit conversion process as a way of performing a needed conversion."

Braces-by-default folks are attracted by their unrivaled breadth of applicability, their prohibition of narrowing conversions, and their immunity to C++’s most vexing parse. Such folks understand that in some cases (e.g., creation of a std::vector with a given size and initial element value), parentheses are required. On the other hand, the go-parentheses-go crowd embraces parentheses as their default argument delimiter. They’re attracted to its consistency with the C++98 syntactic tradition, its avoidance of the auto-deduced-a-std::initializer_list problem, and the knowledge that their object creation calls won’t be inadvertently waylaid by std::initializer_list constructors. They concede that sometimes only braces will do (e.g., when creating a container with particular values). There’s no consensus that either approach is better than the other, so my advice is to pick one and apply it consistently."
