Firstly, there is a bewildering number of ways that a variable can actually be initialised, [highlighted by this joke](http://mikelui.io/img/c++_init_forest.gif). I don't even know what the majority of these mechanisms are. More than this, the different methods of initialisation come with different rules and levels of strictness. [This is a very useful chart](https://josuttis.com/cpp/c++initialization.pdf) to help make the differences easy to compare. On that chart, the notable entries appear to be those shown with red braces. The `Type i{x};` row (and the related `Type i = {x};`) seem to have the advantage for pretty much all of the listed criteria. This makes it a strong choice if those criteria seem useful or important to you, such as enforcing that narrowing operations should result in errors."

Such folks understand that in some cases (e.g., creation of a std::vector with a given size and initial element value), parentheses are required. On the other hand, the go-parentheses-go crowd embraces parentheses as their default argument delimiter. They’re attracted to its consistency with the C++98 syntactic tradition, its avoidance of the auto-deduced-a-std::initializer_list problem, and the knowledge that their object creation calls won’t be inadvertently waylaid by std::initializer_list constructors. They concede that sometimes only braces will do (e.g., when creating a container with particular values).

With C++14 introducing auto for lambda parameters, it became possible to define a function that performs automatic type deduction on all input parameters and its return type. The result is a _generic lambda_ that effectively acts the same as a template with alternative syntax. _(The compiler treats them exactly the same, even down to instantiating the function once for each unique signature required by the calling code)._\n",
