    "# 5 - Lambdas and Closures\n",
    "##### **Author: Adam Gatt**\n",
    "\"Lambdas\" and the related \"closures\" are hugely useful concepts borrowed from [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). In the shortest explanation, a \"lambda\" is an anonymous function and a \"closure\" is a lambda that can include state from its environment at the time of its creation. If this makes sense to you, you might already be familiar with FP. But for this notebook we will work our way up to lambdas, by stepping through the pre-11 concepts of function references and functors."

    "* A sort function needs a \"comparator\" function to tell it which of two elements should come first.\n",

    "* A timer function that accepts another function to be periodically executed.\n",
