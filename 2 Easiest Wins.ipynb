    "Later notebooks will cover more advance topics but the next two will aim to show off simple new language features that you should be able to immediately benefit from with little/no trade-off. Many revolve around enforcing correctness, to help remove some classes of bugs before they have a chance to happen. Additionally, they are largely compile-time features that leave no changes on the compiled code, resulting in no run-time cost. Notebook 4 will then cover a few topics that also bring coding improvements but may require a little thought to ensure you're doing what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) linter will be able to make suggestions about many of these language features, pointing out situation where they can be used. With some care and manual review, you can even run the linter over an entire existing codebase and have the suggestions applied automatically."
