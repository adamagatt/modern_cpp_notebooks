    "How come the call to `scale()` succeeded even though the second parameter was a double instead of a Factor? It's because of the rules C++ uses when parsing a function call. If the compiler can't find a function declaration that matches the called signature, then it will attempt a process called _implicit conversion_. This involves looking around for any other functions that it can use to convert the arguments to types that will allow the original function call to succeed. It is similar to the promotion of primitives, so that you can pass an int to a function that expects a double, except broadened to apply to other types as well. The compiler will search for any user-defined conversion functions and constructors that it can use to perform the conversion process. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here:\n",
    "1. The call to `scale(int, double)` is initially unsuccessful as that signature has not been declared.\n",
    "2. The compiler notices the declaration `scale(int, const Factor&)` and determines if it can convert the arguments to match it.\n",
    "3. The compiler notices that `Factor(double value)` is available for creating a Factor out of a double.\n",
    "4. The compiler inserts the implicit conversion, effectively turning the function call into `scale(5, Factor(0.5))`, and creating a temporary Factor object to submit to the scale function.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ performs implicit conversion not only when calling functions, [but in a range of scenarios](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion) where one type is provided where another is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially this might seem like a benefit, for getting code to work that otherwise wouldn't. But remember that this all happens implicitly behind the scenes, without evidence in the source code itself. As a general rule, you want your application logic to be explicitly laid out to make the code more readable and verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the costs or risks of implicit conversion? They might include:\n",
    " * Function arguments being open to a far greater range of types than intended\n",
    " * An API that is open to guesswork rather than understanding proper usage\n",
    " * Creation of unintended temporary objects\n",
    " * Creation of objects at all that shouldn't be allowed (e.g. if the class is intended Singleton)\n",
    " * Reducing clarity of the intent of the codebase\n",
    " \n",
    "How do we crack down on implicit conversion, assuming we intend to? Remember that the implicit conversion comes about due to three factors:\n",
    "1. A function call with a signature that hasn't been declared\n",
    "2. A candidate signature that could be matched with some conversion\n",
    "3. A conversion function or constructor that can perform the conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the `explicit` keyword is provided to solve our problem by addressing factor 3. A conversion function or constructor that is marked explicit will only be used by the compiler if explicitly called in the codebase. It will not be considered during the implicit conversion process as a way of performing a needed conversion."

    "## Specifying cast expressions (pre-11)\n",
    "C++ brings a dedicated syntax for casting variables between types via the operators:\n",
    "* `static_cast<new_type>(variable)` for compile-time conversions (where a conversion function is available)\n",
    "* `dynamic<new_type>(variable)` for runtime conversions where the type of the object is not necessarily known\n",
    "  * _often used for class inheritance hierarchies, returns null if no conversion is possible_\n",
    "* `const_cast<new_type>(variable)` for modifying the const-ness of the variable\n",
    "* `reinterpret_cast<new_type>(variable)` for simply treating the underlying bit representation as a different type\n",
    "\n",
    "But due to its backwards-compatibility with C, the language allows you to attempt legacy C-style casting:\n",
    "* `(new_type)variable`, or commonly `(new_type*)variable_ptr` for inheritance hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Many who have started with C and moved into C++ continue to use C-style casting and perhaps might not know about the C++ cast expressions, but the behaviour of this is actually a little complicated behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "[As described in cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/explicit_cast), \"when the C-style cast expression is encountered, the compiler attempts to interpret it as the following cast expressions, in this order\":\n",
    "1. const_cast<new_type>(expression);\n",
    "2. static_cast<new_type>(expression), with extensions: pointer or reference to a derived class is additionally allowed to be cast to pointer or reference to unambiguous base class (and vice versa) even if the base class is inaccessible (that is, this cast ignores the private inheritance specifier). Same applies to casting pointer to member to pointer to member of unambiguous non-virtual base;\n",
    "3. static_cast (with extensions) followed by const_cast;\n",
    "4. reinterpret_cast<new_type>(expression);\n",
    "5. reinterpret_cast followed by const_cast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are this isn't what we want. Rather than deciding consciously to work through a list of attempts, we probably have a particular type of cast that we are intending to do. So for improved readability and clarity of our intent we should simply specify that particular cast expression. With the various potential behaviours that the C-style cast can end up becoming, the consistent use of this cast throughout our codebase results in potentially many similarly-appearing expressions that perform different behaviour under the hood."
